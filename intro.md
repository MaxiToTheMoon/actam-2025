# Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies (ACTAM)

## 2025/2026

---

# Course at a Glance!

- Title: **Advanced Coding Tools and Methodologies**
- Exploring the concept of **coding** (what is it??) beyond traditional programming
- Focus on **sound and music** as primary application contexts
- Developing cognitive skills and _taste_ for programming possibilities


---

# Interacting with Computers

- Different modes of interaction:
  - **As users**: running applications (usually doesn't require any technical knowledge)  
  - **As programmers**: creating _applications_ with languages, algorithms, hardware knowledge  
  - (Anything else?)

---

# The Programmer‚Äôs Role

- Ideally: 
  - takes a _description_ of a system (i.e. a videogame)
  - then _implements_ it in _computer code_
- to be fair: not just a translator of human ideas into machine instructions  
- but also:
  - Architect / engineer of complex systems  
  - Designer of software components and their interactions  
  - Responsible for correctness and verification  

---

# Programming in the Age of LLMs

- Large Language Models can automate parts of programming  
- Some specifications can be directly transformed into code  
- **Current reality**:
  - Humans still needed for most projects  
  - LLMs can accelerate, assist, and amplify productivity  
- **Future**: possible shift toward more autonomous coding systems  

---

# What is Coding?


- More than ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù: the practice of interacting with machines programmatically  
- Programming: instructing a computer through formal languages  
- Coding can also be:
  - Exploratory
  - Experimental
  - Creative  
- A **cognitive tool**, not just a technical task

---

# Beyond Implementation

- Coding as a tool for **exploration**:
  - Like pen and paper extending cognition
  - Jupyter, MATLAB, R: support problem-solving and discovery  
- Coding as a tool for **creation**:
  - Music, visuals, generative art  
  - Exploration of multiple design or sound possibilities  
- Coding as a tool for **understanding**:
  - Simulations to explore how systems work (e.g., FM synthesis)  

---

# Course Focus: Sound and Music

- Music chosen as anchor for a wide horizon of applications  
- Topics:
  - Musical applications
  - Live coding performances
  - Programming physical controllers  
- Example: [Live coding performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1FSsUV-8c)
